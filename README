                                               int *, linefold_class *,
                                               linefold_flags),
                         const char *chset, linefold_flags flags);

    Allocate line breaking informations for given unicode text.

    Arguments:
        text:
                Text to be broken.
        textlen:
                Length of `text'.
        find_lbprop_func:
                Function to get a function that get character properties
                of unicode character.  If NULL is specified, built-in
                function will be used.                
        tailor_lbprop:
                Function to tailor character property.  If NULL is specified,
                built-in function will be used.
        chset:
                Charset context.  This is fed to find_lbprop_func(), and
                may referred through `lbinfo' argument fed to
                is_line_exceeded() and writeout_cb().
        flags:
                Bitwise options to customize behavior of line breaking
                (see Option Flags).

    Returns:
        Pointer to allocated `struct linefold_info' data, line breaking
        informations for `text'.  If `text' is NULL, length of `text' is zero,
        or any error occur, NULL will be returned.

void linefold_free(struct linefold_info *lbinfo);

    Free storage allocated by linefold_alloc().

linefold_action
linefold(struct linefold_info *lbinfo, unicode_char *text,
                  int (*is_line_exceeded)(struct linefold_info *,
                                          unicode_char *,
                                          ptrdiff_t, size_t, int),
                  void (*writeout_cb)(struct linefold_info *,
                                      unicode_char *,
                                      ptrdiff_t, size_t, linefold_action),
                  int maxlen, void *voidarg);

    Execute line breaking.

    Arguments:
        lbinfo:
                Line breaking informations.

                Function to determin whether length of a text fragment
                exceeds the limit specified by `maxlen'.  If NULL is
                specified, built-in function will be used.
        writeout_cb:
                Callback function to write out each broken lines (see
                below).  If NULL is specified, linefold() will search
                optimum line breaking points over text but never output
                anything.
        maxlen:
                Limit of line length.
        voidarg:
                A pointer to custom data structure passed to
                is_line_exceeded() and writeout_cb().  If you don't need
                custom data, set this NULL.

    Returns:
        LINEFOLD_ACTION_NOMOD:
                No breaks or only explicit break(s) have occured.
        LINEFOLD_ACTION_INDIRECT:
                Indirect break(s) have occured, but no direct breaks.
        LINEFOLD_ACTION_DIRECT:
                Direct break(s) have occured, and possiblly Indirect
                breaks also.

    Callback function:
        void writeout_cb(struct linefold_info *lbinfo,
                         unicode_char *text, ptrdiff_t start, size_t size,
                         linefold_action action, void *voidarg);

        Called by linefold() when breaking point is found then
        something to output exists.

        Arguments:
            lbinfo:
                    Line breaking informations.
            text:
                    Array of unicode character.

                    Offset of text fragment to output on text.
            size:
                    Length of text fragment to output.
            action:
                    Type of line breaking behavior:
                    LINEFOLD_ACTION_EXPLICIT: Explicit break.
                    LINEFOLD_ACTION_INDIRECT: Indirect break.
                    LINEFOLD_ACTION_DIRECT:   Direct break.
                    LINEFOLD_ACTION_EOT:      This line is the last line
                                              of `text'.
            voidarg:
                    A pointer to custom data structure passed from
                    linefold().

        Note: Terminating newlines and spaces in the text will not be trimmed
          by calling function linefold() (see "Notes" below).  Also
          note that the text may end without newline characters, or may end
          with extra characters (e.g. EOF).


Customization
=============

1. Customizing line breaking properties and rules

To customize line breaking classes, character width informations
or line breaking rules, read mklbproptab.py and relating files.

Note: linebreaktab.c, linebreaktab.h and linebreakrule.html are 
  generated by mklbproptab.py.  Don't edit these files manually.

2. Customizing support functins

Following built-in functions may be customized to meet the needs of your
application.

Note: Don't modify built-in support functions contained in
  linefold.c.  Otherwise, write new functions then
  feed them as arguments of linefold_alloc() and/or
  linefold().

* Argument 'flags' is bitwise options to customize behavior of these
  functions.  For more details see Option Flags.

linefold_lbprop_funcptr linefold_find_lbprop_func(const char *chset,
                                                  linefold_flags flags);

        Find a function to get character property suitable for
        specified charset `chset'.  If `chset' is NULL, length of `chset'
        is zero or appropriate function has not been found, a function
        linefold_find_lbprop_generic(), supporting generic context, should
        be returned. 

void linefold_tailor_lbprop(unicode_char c,
                            int *widthptr, linefold_class *lbcptr,
                            linefold_flags flags);

        Sets customized width and line breaking class information of
        character c.
        `widthptr' and `lbcptr' are pointer to values of width and line
        breaking class.

int linefold_check_length(struct linefold_info *lbinfo,
                                   unicode_char *text,
                                   ptrdiff_t start, size_t len, int maxlen,
                                   void *voidarg);

        Returns boolean value indicating whether width (length) of text
        exceed `maxlen' or not.  `text' is buffer containing text fragment
        to check.  `start' and `textlen' are offset on `text' and length of
        text fragment.


Option Flags
============

LINEFOLD_OPTION_GENERIC_WIDTH           1

  Function: linefold_find_lbprop_func()

  Function: linefold_tailor_lbprop()

  By default, in multibyte character set context, several Latin, Greek
  or Cyrillic letters are treated as Wide.  In some display
  enviroments they are usually rendered as Narrow, even if in
  multibyte context.  Set these options to treat such letters always
  Narrow.

LINEFOLD_OPTION_BREAK_HY                (1<<4)

  Function: linefold_tailor_lbprop()

  Set this to allow break after HY (U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS), before AL.
  By default, breaking directly before AL is not allowed.

LINEFOLD_OPTION_BREAK_SOFT_HYPHEN       (1<<5)

  Function: linefold_tailor_lbprop()

  Set this to allow break after U+00AD SOFT HYPHEN.  By default, breaking
  directly after soft hyphen is not allowed.

LINEFOLD_OPTION_NOBREAK_NL              (1<<6)

  Function: linefold_tailor_lbprop()

  Set this to treat U+0085 NEL as CM, not BK. [UAX#14]

LINEFOLD_OPTION_NOBREAK_VT              (1<<7)

  Function: linefold_tailor_lbprop()

  Set this to treat U+000B vertical tab as CM, not BK. [UAX#14]

LINEFOLD_OPTION_NOHUNG_PUNCT            (1<<8)

  Function: linefold_tailor_lbprop()

  Set this to disable "burasage" (hunging punctuation in East Asian
  text).

LINEFOLD_OPTION_NOGLUE_PUNCT            (1<<9)

  Function: linefold_tailor_lbprop()

  By default, Wide OP/CL characters are treated as if they are a
  Narrow character preceded/followed by SP.  Set this to disable
  such feature.

LINEFOLD_OPTION_IDSP_IS_SP              (1<<10)

  Function: linefold_tailor_lbprop()

  By default, IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE is treated as ID.  Set this to treat
  it as SP.

LINEFOLD_OPTION_RELAX_KANA_NS           (1<<11)

  Set this option not to combine hangul combining jamos (JT, JV, JL)
  when line lengths are determined.

LINEFOLD_OPTION_BREAK_SPCM              (1<<15)

  Function: linefold()

  Set this to break SP+CM sequence. [UAX#14]

LINEFOLD_OPTION_FORCE_LINEWIDTH         (1<<16)

  Function: linefold()

  Set this option to force break unbreakable text longer than specified
  width.  By default, longer text won't be broken.
  This violate line breaking rules then may cause break within words,
  syllables, characters or on somewhere unpreferred.


Notes
=====

1. Newline characters and sequences

Lines broken by Explicit break oppotunity will end with each of
following characters or sequences:

    U+000A line feed (LF)
    U+000B vertical tab (VT) (optional.  See linefold.h).
    U+000C form feed (FF).
    One or more U+000D carriage return (CR), not followed by LF.
    U+0085 new line function (NEL) (optional.  See linefold.h).
    U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR (LS).
    U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR (PS).
    And, one or more CR followed by LF.

2. Long lines

Sometimes lines longer than specified limit appear in output:

a) Sequence of SPACEs terminating Indirect break or sequences of newline
  (see above) terminating Explicit break won't be trimmed.  Line
  breaking algorithm employed by this module expects that SPACEs or newlines
  at end of line will be handled on application side.

b) Long character sequences in which no line break oppotunities are found,
  for example Aopadotenachoselachogaleokranioleipsanodrimhipotrimmatosilphioparaomelitokatakechymenokichlepikossyphophattoperisteralektryonoptekephalliokigklopeleiolagoiosiraiobaphetraganopterygon.
  If you exactly shouldn't allow such pathological cases, Set
  LINEFOLD_OPTION_FORCE_LINEWIDTH on.

c) Tab stop processing is not supported by this module.  Holizontal tab
  will be always treated as a character width 1 column.

d) Hunging punctuation ("burasage") in East Asian text.  This will
  exceed up to one character width of limit.  For more detail read
  LineBreak/CharacterProperties.py, section about custom classes ``CLH''
  and ``CLHSP''.  To disable hunging punctuation, set
  LINEFOLD_OPTION_NO_HUNGING_PUNCT on.

e) Similar case; Wide closing punctuations containing virtual glue.  They
  may exceed one column width of limit.  For more detail read
  LineBreak/CharacterProperties.py, section about custom classes ``CLSP''
  and ``CLHSP''.  To disable virtual glue of wide closing punctuations, Set
  LINEFOLD_OPTION_WIDE_PUNCT_WITHOUT_GLUE on.

f) Inappropriate assignment of character properties, or possiblly
  any characters not yet covered by this module.  If you found such a case,
  please inform me.
